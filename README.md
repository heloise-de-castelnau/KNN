The k-nearest neighbors (KNN) algorithm is a data classification method for estimating the likelihood that a data point will become a member of one group or another based on what group the data points nearest to it belong to. Check [this page](https://towardsdatascience.com/machine-learning-basics-with-the-k-nearest-neighbors-algorithm-6a6e71d01761) for more details.

## What is the project ?

I had to implement this classification Algorithm for a competition in my school. I used the KNN algorithm to predict the class (class A, B, C, D, or E) of an iris flower. To train our algorithm we had two training data files which are _preTest.csv_ and _data.csv_. The test file is _finalTest.csv_ and the labels are written in a _txt_ file.


## Methods

* Euclidian distance
* Get the nearets neighbours
* Prediction about the class
* Satisfaction rate or how to get the right k
* Confusion matrix or how to check if our code is good
